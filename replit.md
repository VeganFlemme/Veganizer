# Veganizer

## Overview

Veganizer is a French web application that converts omnivorous recipes into vegan alternatives with nutritional analysis, climate impact calculations, animal savings tracking, and automated shopping list generation. The application features a modern React frontend with a Node.js/Express backend, utilizing PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for data persistence. It includes a comprehensive database of French recipes, ingredient substitutions, nutritional data based on the Ciqual 2020 database, AGRIBALYSE climate data, and affiliate supplement integration.
